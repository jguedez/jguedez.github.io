yet another blog...
-------------------

I am writing this blog essentially for myself. There are already many good and useful blogs out there, and I have no intention of competing with them (not sure if I could...)

My main goals for this blog are simple:

* I want to be able to look back and see what I have been working on over time (and hopefully see some progress!)

* I will be able to reference some small "tutorials" that I will write for myself when I find a new useful or neat technology/hack. I already use [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) for this and it's fantastic, but it does not work as well for longer content - especially if it includes code (it does not have syntax highlighting, etc.)

* These "rules" can be broken at any time... ;-)
