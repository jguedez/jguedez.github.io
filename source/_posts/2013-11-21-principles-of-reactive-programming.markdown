Odersky's follow-up course on functional programming...
-------------------------------------------------------

I was looking forward to the follow-up course to [Functional Programming
Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun), by Martin
Odersky, the creator of the [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) programming
language. I took that course about a year ago and even though Scala is not one
of my favourite programming languages I can safely say that it was excellent and
I learned a lot.

Finally it's here - [Principles of Reactive Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive),
but it's somewhat different from what I expected when I completed the previous
course.

The course is being taught this time not just by Odersky, but also by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_(computer_scientist)">Erik Meijer</a>
(of C#/LINQ fame) and by Roland Kuhn, from the Akka team. The course consists of
three sections, one for each professors - as you can imagine Odersky is teaching
a general introduction while Meijer and Kuhn cover more specialized concepts
like asynchronous computations and actors.

I have been enjoying it so far. It seems a lot of people are complaining about
the time requirements and difficulty compared to the previous course. The
concepts are definitely more advanced this time around (monads...), and I've
limited exposure to them - while I had some knowledge about FP in general for
the first course (completing the "Little Schemer" made me familiar with
recursion).

I am looking forward to the section about actors (it's the last part), as I have
heard a lot about it in relation to Erlang and Akka but have never actually
played with it.

I think I am starting to like Scala more this time around. This might also be
the result of reading more and more about the benefits of having a type system.
I think I am starting to get the hang of it after using mainly dynamic languages
for a long time (Python!). I also think that being exposed to all these different
paradigms is being beneficial and gives me a better perspective.
